# Music Intelligence Lab (μLab)

## Mission

We explore the intersection of music, technology, and intelligence by combining science, mathematics, and machine learning with cultural traditions. Our goal is to empower music creation in ways that are personal, human, and deeply meaningful.

## Vision

Music represents three interconnected forms of intelligence:

- **Physical Intelligence**: The embodied musical experience and muscle memory that develops through practice
- **Mathematical Intelligence**: The relationships between sounds, harmonic structures, and patterns
- **Computational Intelligence**: Signal analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning

Our lab bridges these intelligences to preserve human creativity while exploring technological possibilities, creating new ways of experiencing and understanding musical expression.

## Research Areas

### Intelligent Musical Interfaces
We focus on designing novel musical instruments and developing algorithms for music generation, with particular emphasis on Arabic music's unique features and modes of expression.

### Algorithmic and Data-Driven Composition
We explore generative AI in music creation and investigate real-time generation for improvisation, concentrating on Arabic music's distinctive tuning systems and compositional practices.

### Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Arabic Music
We develop music information retrieval (MIR) algorithms to analyze Arabic music's cultural and historical contexts, addressing unique challenges like quarter tones and microtonal systems.

### Arabic Maqam Archive
A web-based platform for exploring Arabic maqām theory, integrating historical tuning systems and musical modes, and utilizing network analysis for musicological research.
